# Pneumonia
Created a Convolutional Neural Network Model which is able to correctly predict that the patient is suffering from Pneumonia or not by using that person’s chest X-ray. 
Our deep learning model is able to classify the image with 91% accuracy. So the model we have created works fine on classifying the data it has never seen before. So we can use this model to predict whether the person is Normal or suffering from Pneumonia with the help of that person’s Chest X-ray image.
